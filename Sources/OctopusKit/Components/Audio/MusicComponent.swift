// TODO: Use `AVAudioPlayer`, as it is more suitable for music according to Apple documentation.

// CHECK: A way to add multiple `AudioComponent`s to an entity, as GameplayKit replaces older components of the same type? We may only want a single `MusicComponent` but multiple `AudoComponents`.

// BUG: `isPositional = false` does not seem to be working.
