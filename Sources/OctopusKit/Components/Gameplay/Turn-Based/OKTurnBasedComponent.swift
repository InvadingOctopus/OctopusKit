/// Turn-based components still have a per-frame `update(deltaTime:)` cycle and may perform per-frame updates like all other components, but they also have special methods that must be manually called to perform tasks for each discrete game-defined turn.

/// - IMPORTANT: Turn-based components must also be added to the component systems list of an `OKTurnBasedScene` to be updated in a deterministic order.
